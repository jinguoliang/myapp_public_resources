Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is an agreement between me (JINUX, an independent developer) and you (the product user). Mainly about how the app handles data about you.

Mobile Privacy Permissions:

The functional needs of the application may require some permissions on your phone, such as:
1. Permission to access media data, which is used to select pictures, audios, and customize functions related to the application.
2. Recording permission, used to record your performance or singing works

Rest assured, when using these permissions, the app will prompt for instructions to ask for your consent.

User interaction data:

In order to develop the application in the future, I need to understand the user's use of the application. for example
1. App crash information
2. User interface interaction, page access

User Generated Content:

The user creates some content that will not be uploaded to the app's servers for the time being, but may be reported as escalated content.
Rest assured, I will never share the relevant data for purposes other than analyzing app usage

The app provides the function of importing and exporting user-created content. Please be careful not to share content containing private data on the public network, and be careful when using content shared by others.
